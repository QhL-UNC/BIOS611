Hi, this is my BIOS 611 Data Science Project. 
In this git repository, you can find 4 folders: Data, Program, Document, and Figures. Data contains the original two datasets related to sleep, Program has the R scripts for the analysis, Document has the final project report in pdf and word formats, and Figures has all the figures used in the final report. 
Also, you can find Dockerfile, README, makefile under the main branch. Dockerfile includes how to build R and R packages under docker. Makefile cleans all the figures and regenrate them. README has an introduction about this project. 
My project explores the association of demographics, life style, blood pressure, and sleep disorder with sleep effiiency and total sleep time. Using marginal association and linear model, this study found that there are multiple factors associated with sleep efficiency and total sleep time, including alcohol consumption, BMI, exercise frequency and activity level, blood pressure, stress level,  and heart rate are negatively associated with sleep efficiency and total sleep time.
